## More About the Project
I designed and built this project end to end without following any specific tutorial. My goal was to learn by doing and gain more experience using JavaScript ES6+ features. I decided to use a MVC design pattern and JS classes to practice separation of concerns and functional programming principles. I also worked on connecting to third party APIs, async/await syntax, and promises.     

## Improvements and Future Features
- Search input box for users to find information about locations different from their own 
- Specific recommendations based on the time of year
